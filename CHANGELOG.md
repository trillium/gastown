  only.
- **Copilot agent support** — GitHub Copilot CLI documented and preset updated
  for GA release (Feb 2026).
- **Unique polecat namepool** — Polecat names are now globally unique across
  rigs via shared namepool with auto-assigned themes.
- **Handoff restart prompt** — `gt handoff` now prompts the user before

  at startup and after compaction.
- **Boot and dog cost tiers** — Boot and dog roles now tracked in the cost tier
  system.

  using hardcoded lists; reaper uses `DiscoverDatabases` with proper error
  handling.
- **Dolt `dolt_transaction_commit` disabled** — Prevents read-only commit
  storms on busy servers.

### Fixed

- **Daemon beads compatibility guard** — `gt daemon run` now fail-fast checks
  workspace beads schema compatibility before Convoy polling starts, and
  `gt daemon start` surfaces the startup mismatch directly instead of only
  telling operators to inspect logs.
- **Dolt server stability** — Fixed thundering herd in `doltserver.Start()`,
  port-squatter detection and kill on startup, `cmd.Dir` set on all CLI/SQL
  invocations to prevent stray `.doltcfg` directories, and timing race in
  startup sequence.
- **Security hardening** — Bead ID suffix validation enforced, formula
  variables use bead IDs instead of user-supplied titles, and
  `--subject`/`--args` sanitized before tmux pane injection.
- **Tmux reliability** — Replaced timing-based Enter delivery with
  verification-based retry, detect and dismiss Claude Code Rewind menu during
  nudge delivery, restored per-town socket isolation, and added flock-based
  cross-process nudge lock to prevent interleaved delivery.
- **Windows fixes** — Atomic counter in `generateStampID` for timer resolution,
  pipe deadlock prevention in `prime_test`, process group test skips, and
  multiple CI test stabilizations.
- **Polecat lifecycle** — Skip crash/zombie alerts for done/nuked polecats,
  use `IsIdle` instead of `IsAtPrompt` for startup nudge verify, clean dirty
  worktree before reuse, kill session unconditionally when reusing idle
  polecats, and wire operational config into startup nudge loop.
- **Refinery fixes** — Use commit SHA instead of branch name for MR dedup,
  supersede MR on same-branch re-submission, check `no_merge` flag before
  merging, close task beads after successful merge, wait for CI in PR mode,
  and filter MR listings by rig to prevent cross-rig contamination.
- **Convoy fixes** — Use Unix epoch instead of zero time for initial event poll,
  stranded scan checks completion status, create legs in target rig beads,
  and cross-rig dependency routing uses town root.
- **Cross-town safety** — Prevent orphan cleanup from killing agents on other
  towns' sockets, distinguish sibling Gas Town instances from test zombies.
- **Dog and daemon** — Clear agent identity env vars at startup, prevent
  duplicate Mayor spawns during `gt up`, auto-clear hung dogs and orphan
  sessions, include dogs in startup retry loop, prevent daemon restart during
  `gt down`, and respect global default agent for dog spawns.
- **Doctor improvements** — Avoid slow `filepath.Walk` on Docker bind mounts,
  stale `sql-server.info` detection, hooks-sync check detects stale Gemini
  settings, route misclassified wisp fixes by workdir, and repair relocated
  worktree gitdir paths.
- **Mail and communication** — Drain crashed polecat notifications, prefer
  `GT_TOWN_ROOT` env var for town root detection, fall back to explicit agent
  workspaces for mail delivery.
- **Dolt plugins** — `dolt-archive` uses `while-read` loops for bash 3.2
  compatibility (macOS), `dolt-backup` uses `$HOME/gt` as `GT_ROOT` fallback,
  named Docker volume prevents journal corruption on macOS, and `grep -v`
  exit code handled under `pipefail`.
- **Formula and molecule** — Cap backoff before overflow in `await-event` and
  `await-signal`, inject `merge_strategy` from rig settings into formula vars,
  propagate `base_branch` to MR target in `gt done` and `gt mq submit`.
- **Sling** — Serialize concurrent hook writes with per-assignee flock,
  `--dry-run` detects tmux session collision before spawn, guard `sha[:8]`
  slice against short hashes.
- **Config and identity** — Dog sessions inherit env vars from base agent, custom
  agents inherit Session/Tmux from preset, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` respected in
  `gt costs`, rig prefix pattern refresh when stale, propagate
  `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_HOST` to subprocesses, and repair PROJECT IDENTITY
  MISMATCH after crash.
- **Guard and compliance** — Block polecats from pushing directly to main.
- **Misc** — `formatPeriod` returns "Week of" on Mondays instead of "Today",
  sync `agent_state` between column and description on transitions, validate
  git URL before crew clone, `--flat` flag on all `bd list --json` calls to
  guarantee JSON output, `gt upgrade` repairs missing identity beads, and
  `CLAUDE.local.md` added to gitignore patterns.

### Removed

_Release contained incremental fixes between v0.9.0 and v0.10.0. See git log for details._

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Batch-then-bisect merge queue** — Bors-style MQ batches MRs, runs tests on
  the tip, and binary-bisects on failure. GatesParallel runs test + lint
  concurrently per MR.
- **Persistent polecats** — Polecat identity and sandbox survive across work
  assignments. Sessions are ephemeral; identity accumulates forever. `gt done`
  transitions to idle instead of nuking.
- **Compactor Dog** — Daily Dolt commit history flattening via `DOLT_RESET --soft`.
  Runs on live server, no downtime. Configurable threshold. Includes surgical
  interactive rebase for advanced use.
- **Doctor Dog** — Automated health monitoring patrol for Dolt server. Detects
  zombies, orphan databases, and stale locks. Reports structured data for agent
  decision-making (ZFC-compliant).
- **JSONL Dog** — Spike detection and pollution firewall for JSONL backup exports.
  Scrubs test artifacts before git commit.
- **Wisp Reaper Dog** — Automated wisp GC with DELETE of closed wisps >7d, auto-close
  of stale issues >30d, and mail purge >7d.
- **Root-only wisps** — Formula steps no longer materialized as individual database
  rows. Single root wisp per formula. Cuts ~6,000 ephemeral rows/day from Dolt.
- **Six-stage data lifecycle** — CREATE, LIVE, CLOSE, DECAY, COMPACT, FLATTEN,
  all automated via Dogs. `EnsureLifecycleDefaults()` auto-populates daemon.json
  on startup.
- **`gt maintain`** — One-command Dolt maintenance (flatten + gc).
- **`gt vitals`** — Unified health dashboard command.
- **`gt upgrade`** — Post-binary migration command for config propagation.
- **`gt convoy stage`** — Stage convoys with `--title` flag and smart defaults.
- **`gt mol await-signal`** — Alias for step-level signal awaiting.
- **`gt daemon clear-backoff`** — Reset exponential backoff on daemon restarts.
- **`gt mq post-merge`** — Branch cleanup after refinery merge.
- **`gt mail drain`** — Drain inbox command.
- **Sandbox sync** — Branch-only polecat reuse with `pool-init`.
- **Per-worker agent selection** — `worker_agents` config for crew members.
- **Dangerous-command guard hook** — Blocks `cp -i`, `mv -i`, `rm -i` in agent sessions.
- **Log rotation** — Daemon and Dolt server logs now rotate with gzip compression.
- **Did-you-mean suggestions** — Unknown subcommands suggest closest match.
- **`gt version --verbose/--short`** — Version display options.
- **Town-root CLAUDE.md version check** — `gt doctor` detects stale CLAUDE.md files.
- **Lifecycle defaults doctor check** — Detects missing daemon.json patrol entries.

### Changed

- **OperationalConfig for config-driven thresholds (ZFC)** — Hardcoded thresholds
  for hung sessions, stale claims, max retries, GUPP violations, and crash-loop
  backoff are now in `operational.json`. Go code reads config; agents set values.
- **Nudge-first communication** — Protocol messages (LIFECYCLE, WORK_DONE,
  merge notifications) changed from permanent mail to ephemeral wisps or nudges.
  Reduces Dolt commit volume by ~80% for patrol traffic.
- **Default Dolt log level** changed from debug to info.
- **Convoy IDs** shortened from 5 chars to 3.
- **Mail purge age** reduced from 30 days to 7 days.
- **Compactor threshold** bumped from 500 to 10,000 commits.
- **Default max Dolt connections** bumped from 200 to 1,000.
- **Dolt flatten runs on live server** — No maintenance window needed.

### Fixed

- **Mail delivery** — Fixed `--id` flag breaking all mail creation paths. Fixed
  recipient validation to include pinned and inactive agents. Added auto-nudge
  on mail delivery to idle agents.
- **Witness patrol** — Stopped nuking idle polecats. Stopped auto-closing permanent
  issues (ZFC violation). Replaced screen-scraping with structured signals for
  stalled polecat detection.
- **Polecat lifecycle** — Prevent sleepwalking completions with zero commits. Normalize
  CWD to git root before beads resolution. Preserve remote branches when MR pending.
  Close orphan step wisps before closing root molecule.
- **Refinery** — Removed dead `findTownRoot` filesystem inference (ZFC). Removed
  hardcoded severity/priority logic. Made stale-claim thresholds config-driven.
  Extracted typed `ConvoyFields` accessor.
- **Boot triage** — Removed ZFC-violating decision engine from degraded boot triage.
- **PID detection** — Replaced PID signal probing with heartbeat-based liveness.
  Replaced ps string matching with nonce-based PID files. Replaced per-PID pgrep
  with single ps-based process tree scan.
- **tmux** — Use default socket instead of per-town socket. Set `window-size=latest`
  on detached sessions. Auto-dismiss workspace trust dialog blocking agent sessions.
- **Convoy** — Prevent auto-close of stuck convoys. Recovery sweep after Dolt
  reconnect. Check parked AND docked rigs in dispatch. Prevent double-spawn from
  stale feed. Idempotent close handling.
- **Doctor** — Fixed silent failure for agent-beads and misclassified-wisps checks.
  Repair beads redirect targets with missing config.yaml. Handle worktree branch
  conflicts. Skip rig dirs whose .beads symlinks to town root.
- **Test isolation** — Migrate test infrastructure to testcontainers. Ephemeral Dolt
  server per test suite. `BEADS_TEST_MODE=1` enforcement. Dropped 45 zombie test
  servers (7GB RAM).
- **Rig lifecycle** — Enforce dock/park across all startup, patrol, and sling paths.
  Dogs correctly use plugin lookup. Formula lookup falls back to embedded for
  non-gastown rigs.
- **Handoff** — Deterministic git state in handoff context. Fix socket confusion
  using caller socket. Preserve conversation context on PreCompact cycle.
- **Windows** — Cross-compilation fixes for `syscall.Flock`, `syscall.SIGUSR2`,
  bash-dependent tests, `GOPATH/bin` creation, batch mock caret escaping.
- **Hardcoded strings** — Replaced ~50 hardcoded state/status string comparisons
  with typed enums across witness, refinery, and beads packages.
- **CI** — Fixed lint errors (errcheck, misspell) and integration test port collision.

### Added

#### Priming Subsystem
- **PRIME.md provisioning** - Auto-provision PRIME.md at rig level so all workers inherit Gas Town context (GUPP, hooks, propulsion) (#hq-5z76w)
- **Post-handoff detection** - `gt prime` detects handoff marker and outputs "HANDOFF COMPLETE" warning to prevent handoff loop bug (#hq-ukjrr)

- **Remove PID-based detection** - Agent liveness from tmux, not PIDs
- **Agent-controlled thresholds** - Stuck detection moved to agent config
- **Remove pending.json tracking** - Eliminated anti-pattern

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-09

Worker safety release - prevents accidental termination of active agents.

> **Note**: The Deacon safety improvements are believed to be correct but have not
> yet been extensively tested in production. We recommend running with
> `gt deacon pause` initially and monitoring behavior before enabling full patrol.
> Please report any issues. A 0.3.0 release will follow once these changes are
> battle-tested.

### Critical Safety Improvements

- **Kill authority removed from Deacon** - Deacon patrol now only detects zombies via `--dry-run`, never kills directly. Death warrants are filed for Boot to handle interrogation/execution. This prevents destruction of worker context, mid-task progress, and unsaved state (#gt-vhaej)
- **Bulletproof pause mechanism** - Multi-layer pause for Deacon with file-based state, `gt deacon pause/resume` commands, and guards in `gt prime` and heartbeat (#265)
- **Doctor warns instead of killing** - `gt doctor` now warns about stale town-root settings rather than killing sessions (#243)
- **Orphan process check informational** - Doctor's orphan process detection is now informational only, not actionable (#272)

### Added

- **`gt account switch` command** - Switch between Claude Code accounts with `gt account switch <handle>`. Manages `~/.claude` symlinks and updates default account
- **`gt crew list --all`** - Show all crew members across all rigs (#276)
- **Rig-level custom agent support** - Configure different agents per-rig (#12)
- **Rig identity beads check** - Doctor validates rig identity beads exist
- **GT_ROOT env var** - Set for all agent sessions for consistent environment
- **New agent presets** - Added Cursor, Auggie (Augment Code), and Sourcegraph AMP as built-in agent presets (#247)
- **Context Management docs** - Added to Witness template for better context handling (gt-jjama)

### Fixed

- **`gt prime --hook` recognized** - Doctor now recognizes `gt prime --hook` as valid session hook config (#14)
- **Integration test reliability** - Improved test stability (#13)
- **IsClaudeRunning detection** - Now detects 'claude' and version patterns correctly (#273)
- **Deacon heartbeat restored** - `ensureDeaconRunning` restored to heartbeat using Manager pattern (#271)
- **Deacon session names** - Correct session name references in formulas (#270)
- **Hidden directory scanning** - Ignore `.claude` and other dot directories when enumerating polecats (#258, #279)
- **SetupRedirect tracked beads** - Works correctly with tracked beads architecture where canonical location is `mayor/rig/.beads`
- **Tmux shell ready** - Wait for shell ready before sending keys (#264)
- **Gastown prefix derivation** - Correctly derive `gt-` prefix for gastown compound words (gt-m46bb)
- **Custom beads types** - Register custom beads types during install (#250)

### Changed

- **Refinery Manager pattern** - Replaced `ensureRefinerySession` with `refinery.Manager.Start()` for consistency

### Removed

- **Unused formula JSON** - Removed unused JSON formula file (cleanup)

### Contributors
